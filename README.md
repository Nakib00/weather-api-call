# weather-api-call
This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to work with APIs to retrieve data and display it on a webpage. Additionally, I have implemented error handling to inform the user if their search query is invalid or if there is an issue with the API call.
